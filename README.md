## In this project, I will build a web page entirely from scratch, without using any libraries. I will apply all the HTML, CSS, Accessibility, and Responsive Design skills I have previously learned.

## I have minimal instructions, giving me the freedom to implement it as I see fit. The goal is simple: to create a fully functional web page that exactly matches the designerâ€™s file.

## Interactions note:

-   the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
-   links hover/active: #FF6565
-   button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
-   max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

## Project Requirements

-   **CSS Framework:** Do not import external CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.
-   **JavaScript:** Avoid the use of JavaScript in this implementation.
